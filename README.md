# Data-Cleaning-EDA-ML-Project
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline using Python. It includes data cleaning (handling missing values and outliers), data preprocessing (label encoding, normalization), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training using K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
